This is just a place for notes as I do research. Fundamentally, from what I remember and what I can find online, the longhouses we built (Menominees) were basically the same as iroquois longhouses. Made of hardened curved big sticks (I'll figure out the correct term for these) and covered in birchbark. There doesn't seem to be a great way to simulate this internal structure in minecraft, so I think I might just use birch wood. It doesn't get the inside of the birch bark on the inside of the longhouse, nor the poles, but I think I will like it better than logs because logs are more wrong in my opinion. Fundamentally, the thickness of the blocks is greater than we would build longhouses, which had a lot to do with why they were a summer only houseing option for us. Wigwams are thicker and the smaller dome keeps in heat better. 

I will eventually get a blueprint of what I do up, jsyk.  But I want the dimentions to be correct to life. We tended to build really really long longhouses when we built them because they would house everyone who would gather over the summer, so I want to build a longhouse that is in the upper end of how long they tended to get. I want to assume each block to be about three feet wide, as I need two blocks high as a minimum to walk through a passageway, and I assume I'm around 6 feet tall in game. 

Some longhouses were up to 400 feet long, but most were closer to 200 feet. Like I said, Menominees built pretty long ones from what I know, so I want mine to be 300 feet I think. That will be 100 blocks long.

It looks like iroquois longhouses were 20 to 23 feet wide, so that will be 7-8 blocks in the interior. For now I am going to play with getting the external structure to look right, as the roof should be somewhat domed with somewhat lower sides by modern standards... the shape is so organic it will be interesting to approximate it with blocks.
